# Code Institute Milestone Project

The goal is to demonstrate the technologies that I have learnt through the User Centric Module provided by the Code Institute.
The challenge was to create a frontend only website for a 1960’s Rock Band called, The Monkees. I have used HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap to show my ability, skill and understanding of technologies learned so far.
The project was to create a website targeted to fans who would come to the site to see and hear clips from the band’s library, for fans to stay up to date with new content and events as they become available whilst also attracting a new fan base. And to promote the band’s availability to perform at special events.

## UX
The website was designed and created to be focused towards the band’s fan base and potential fans. 
I have used bright fun colours throughout the site to create typography and to visually appeal to the user.
The colour, style and theme were created to reflect the persona of the band as found on the bands official site [The Monkees](https://www.monkees.com/).
The business requirements are to create a website that is easy to use and allows for sign ups. 
And for fans and potential fans to contact the band to make enquiries about their availability to perform at special events.

## The Five Planes

### The Strategy Plane

**Site Objectives**
* A website targeted to the band’s fans and potential fans.
* An easy to navigate website that showcases the band’s music.
* A sign-up section to stay up to date with new content releases and an option to contact the band.

**User Stories**
* As a fan I would like to visit the site to view images of the band and to listen to their music.
* As a fan I would like to visit the site to keep up to date with new material releases as it becomes available and to follow the band on social media.
* As a fan I would like to visit the site to view the band tour dates so I can find and buy concert tickets.
* As a potential fan I would like to be able to visit the site to find out more information about the band and the type of music they play.
* As a fan or potential fan of the band I would like to be able to visit the site and contact the band to find out the bands availability to perform at private events.

### The Scope Plane

* Navigation bar links to each section of the site for quick and easy user access.
* Easy to read font and colour theme across all sections.
* Possibly add call to action above navbar to inform user that the band can perform at private events.

**Information Architecture**
* Single scroll website from home page through to the band, their music, their tour dates, and contact information.
* Possibly add a news article section for latest news from the band.

### The Skeleton Plane

**Wireframes & Features**
I originally created my wireframes in Balsamiq however I found this to be a little restrictive in terms of the design process as I wanted to show more detail for my first project.
So, I choose to switch to a simpler form and used PowerPoint to create and style my wireframes.


![Home](/wireframes/home.jpg/)
* The home page should have a navigation bar for quick easy access to any part of the site.
* Main body of the home page to have a full width image possibly a carousel with multi slide images.

![Band](/wireframes/band.jpg/)
* Images of each band member with some additional information their name and the instruments they play.
* Additional group images of the band.

![Music](/wireframes/music.jpg/)
* Embedded band music video centre of page.
* Band album images with audio play list.

![Tour](/wireframes/tour.jpg/)
* Images of city's were the band are scheduled to play concert.

![Contact](/wireframes/contact.jpg/)
* Sign up section to the band’s newsletter.
* Form for the user to contact the band to enquire about private hire.

![Footer](/wireframes/footer.jpg/)
* Band social links.

### The Surface Plane

**Visual Design**
* Bright fun colours to be used across the site, yellow as the base colour for the site and google fonts "Acme". 
* Colour theme to be kept simple no more than 3-4 colours to be used across all sections.
* Full width home page image with call to action above navbar.
* Fixed background image taken from the bands image library.

## Features
* The website is a single scrolling page split into five sections. The first section is the Homepage which contains a full screen image and rotates to show 2 images of the band.
* The Navigation bar is located at the top of the screen and can be used to quickly link through to any part of the site.
* The second section is “Meet the Band” which contains individual images of each band member, a brief bio of each band members name, date of birth and roles they play within the band. Along with some additional images of the band.
* The third section is music from the band which has a video of the band performing one of their famous songs. Album cover images along with some audio songs.
* Following this is the tour section which contains images of city’s where the band will be playing their concerts.  
* And a section to sign up to the bands newsletter and a form to contact the band to make enquiries about their availability to perform at private events.
* Finally, the footer which contains links to the band’s social media.

## Features still to implement
* Add call to action above navbar.
* Add missing audio files for the album section, currently only 2 of the audio files are linked to the correct music. 
* Update the view tickets modal to show band tour dates and add link to buy tickets.

## Technologies Used
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) markup language used for the site.
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) used for styling and formatting of site.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework & components used for website layout.
* [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) used for social media icons.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) provides a selection of fonts.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com) & [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) required for Bootstrap functionality.

## Testing
* I started by validating my HTML and CSS code using the W3C validator. This highlighted a typo I had missed were I had put a backspace on a break tag. 
* Upon reviewing the site in google chrome dev tools I discovered a 400 error which directed me to my CSS file on row 1. The error message was due to a typo within @import fonts which was corrected.
* The second error message was 404 which directs me to an image located within my images. At present I haven’t been able to resolve the issue.
* Upon reviewing the site on multiple devices, I noticed the load time for some of the images took longer than I had anticipated. This was due to the size of the image files being 2mb plus, the optimal size for quick smooth loading is generally 80Kb-100Kb at most [as stated on google]( https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ei=_u9yXP7zH4HSxgOsoK3QBg&q=What+is+the+best+file+size+for+web+images%3F&oq=What+is+the+best+file+size+for+web+images%3F&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i22i30.254114.254114..255224...0.0..0.71.71.1......0....2j1..gws-wiz.......0i71.Ew8VTGdJczY).
* I had asked a family member to review the site and they had not noticed the band detail collapse and album music collapse. I did the same with my mentor and Guido who also hadn’t noticed the collapse and suggested that I remove it.

## Credits
#### Content
Information regarding each band member was taking from [AllMusic](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-monkees-mn0000478603/biography). I assigned each member a specific roll within the band i.e. vocals, drum, bass, guitar using the bands video of I'm A Believer [YouTube 1:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv2MLlZKarM).
The album songs listed were taken from [The Top Tens](https://www.thetoptens.com/best-monkees-songs/).
For the contact us sign up form and private hire form I took inspiration from the [Monkees official site]( https://www.monkees.com/). 

#### Media
A large inventory of media files were provided by the Code Institute through [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/project-assets). Additional assets were sourced from [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/b8549efe-f4fd-4dc0-8ef1-226e9c400233) website.

Special thanks go to my mentor Guido Cecilio who helped me to resolve a specific issue I came across on the carousel.
The cause of the issue was due to using an older version of the BootstrapCDN file which Guido was kind enough to show me how identify the issue for future reference so I could investigate and resolve.
